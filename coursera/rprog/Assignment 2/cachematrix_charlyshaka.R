## The following functions calculate the inverse of a matrix and saves it
## to the cache such that the next time the user attempts to calculate the
## matrix inverse, the previously saved value is returned instead of
## repeating the calculation.
## This function creates a special "matrix" object, which is really a list
## containing a function to
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the inverse
## 4. get the value of the inverse
makeCacheMatrix_cc <- function(x = matrix()) {
  ## create a matrix object x and some associated sub-functions/methods
  ## define the cache m
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y ## assign the input matrix y to the variable x in the
    ## parent environment
    m <<- NULL ## re-initialize m in the parent environment to null
  }
  get <- function() x ## return the matrix x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse ## set the cache m equal
  ## to the inverse of the matrix x

## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created
## with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the inverse
## has already been caclulated. If so, it 'get's the inverse from the cache
## and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the matrix inverse
## and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the 'setinverse' function.
